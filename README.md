## Secure-Password-Gen

# Description
The project is a program which generates a secure password when run in the terminal. The password generated is random and contains Capital letters, non-capital letters and numbers.
This program relies heavily on the ```java.util.Random``` class to produce the randomized password.

# How to Run the Program?
The program can simply be run by downloading the Main.java file and then compiling the file in the terminal by using ```javac Main.java``` command which produces Main.class . Next, to activate the program, ```java Main.class``` should be typed in the terminal which would give you the secure password.

Alternatively, any online java compiler can also be used by simply copy-pasting the code into the compiler and running the code.
